<p>LoanBook is a desktop application targetted at bicycle shop owners to manage their bicycle loans. This will allow the bicycle shop owners who are proficient with the Command Line Interface (CLI) to keep track of their loans, and simplify the auditing process. You may find the code of the application here: <a href="https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main">Loanbook github page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The users interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. The code base has approximately 20 thousand lines of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LoanBook&#8217;s <strong>core functionalities</strong> include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keeping track of the status of bicycle rentals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping track of bicycles within the shop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing users to send reminder emails to people who took out loans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating a summary of the application&#8217;s data</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Added a command that allows the user to return a loan.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature</strong>: Allows the user to mark a loan that has been returned and prompts the user with the total price of the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This simplifies the bicycle return process by allowing the user to simply key in a command, and get the payable cost of the loan. As well, it will mark the loan with the correct status so that the <code>summary</code> functionality audits the LoanBook correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The implementation of this feature required the creation of 3 new classes, 2 of which were implemented by me. The time of when the loan is returned defaults to the current time, and this data is saved into the LoanBook.</p>

<p>So how do you even return a loan that you have loaned out? You can do so with this simple command! In fact, we see your pains trying to calculate the amount payable on a calculator, so we decided to help you out by doing all the number crunching for you.</p>
</div>

<p>This command marks a loan as returned based on LOAN_INDEX and automatically prints out the amount payable. The amount payable will be prorated and rounded down to the nearest minute.<br></p>

<p>We choose to do this because when we get down to seconds, the difference in the earnings you will get is going to be on the order of a fraction of cents. We hope that by doing this, your business would not seem to be very petty about the money.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, this would be good for your business, as customers will not feel that they have been ripped off the cost of renting a bike for an extra minute just because you took 5 seconds to log their return details! :)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A LoanBook application that only allows users to do loans without being able to return them would not serve its purpose. When you take out a loan, it should automatically come with the feature of being returnable. This is the functionality for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">Current Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The source code for this implementation can be found in <a href="../../src/main/java/loanbook/logic/commands/ReturnCommand.java">ReturnCommand.java</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Returning a loan is done by setting the corresponding status of the loan to <code>LoanStatus.RETURNED</code>. Other than setting the enum to be returned, the cost of the loan will also be calculated and displayed to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The steps that have to be done by LoanBook is as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check the start and end time of the loan to ensure that the loan period is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store the current time as the return time of the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the enum of <code>LoanStatus</code> to become <code>LoanStatus.RETURNED</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the cost of the loan and display it in the GUI as a suggestion for the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is summarized in the following Activity Diagram:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ReturnFlow.png" alt="ReturnFlow" width="450">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These steps would change the given <code>Loan</code> object, and update the properties of the <code>Loan</code> object. The appropriate values stored within the <code>Loan</code> object would therefore change accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenerio and how the internals of the Loan would behave:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user would have to do a search for which loan they would like to return. This will pull up a list of loans from which the user would be able to select the correct loan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Using the current system time as the <code>endTime</code>, the duration of the loan will be calculated. Should the duration ever be negative, an error message will be thrown. This is because such a scenario would not ever be possible in the LoanBook.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The user decides to return the current loan (in the case of the above image, the user wants to return loan at index 3, as selected). User will therefore key in <code>return i/3</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The LoanBook will save the current time into the <code>LoanTime endTime</code> field. This would be done by calling the constructor <code>LoanTime()</code>. Also, the loanStatus field would also be updated from <code>ONGOING</code> to <code>RETURNED</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/return-loan-loan2.png" alt="return loan loan2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that originally the loan has a <code>null</code> value for end time. Note that the <code>endTime</code> and <code>loanStatus</code> values has been updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">

<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>

If the loan has already been returned or deleted, a corresponding error message will notify you that you cannot return a loan that is not ongoing. This check happens during this step.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#160;<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> The function now calculates the cost of the loan. This price would be based on the amount of time the loan was active for, as well as the loanRate that was set, by multiplying the time with the rate.</p>

<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>

Although the time saved is to the millisecond, the time that is multiplied when we are getting the cost is rounded down to the nearest minute. In a sense, this is "pro-rating" the cost, and making it more discrete.

<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement the return a loan feature, and do not need to create new data storage features.</p>

<p>Cons: When using the <code>summary</code> function, it will take a longer amount of time, as the LoanBook would have to do a check at every step to ensure the correct data is appended to the correct place.</p>

<p>Alternative 2: Create new ArrayLists of <code>Loans</code> for each possible status of the <code>Loan</code> objects.</p>

<li>
<p>Pros: Computing the <code>summary</code> of the LoanBook would be much easier, and quicker.</p>
