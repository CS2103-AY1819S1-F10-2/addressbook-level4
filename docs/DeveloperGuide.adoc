== Setting up
This section describes the necessary dependencies required to work on the application.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Make sure the correct JDK version is set up for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`. A window titled 'Project Structure for New Projects' will pop up
.. Under the "Project SDK" heading, select the correct JDK version (JDK 9 or later).
... If the correct version does not appear in the drop-down list, click `New...` > `JDK`, then select the directory folder of the JDK, then click `OK`. +
For Windows, the default installation directory would be `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-[version-number]`
.. Click `OK` to accept the settings and close the window.
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file in this project's root directory on your computer and select it. Click `OK`. A window titled 'Import Project from Gradle' will pop up
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings. Gradle will now start building your project. Wait a short while for it to complete (it will say `main: sync finished` in IntelliJ's Build tab  when it is done)
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/storage/XmlAdaptedLoan.java[`XmlAdaptedLoan.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/loanbook/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/loanbook/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `loanbook.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, you may move on to <<Design-Architecture>> to get some sense of the overall design.

== Design
This section describes the implementation of the application.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i/1 x/a12345`.

.Component interactions for `delete i/1 x/a12345` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteLoan.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `LoanBookChangedEvent` when the Loan Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete i/1 x/a12345` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteLoanEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `LoanListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `LoanBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a loan) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete i/1 x/a12345")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete i/1 x/a12345` Command
image::DeleteLoanSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The model component:
* stores the LoanBook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Loan>` that can be 'observed' by the UI, so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the model changes.
* stores the user's preferences.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

It allows the following operations:
* Viewing, adding, modifying and deleting Bikes and Loans from the LoanBook.
* Retrieving lists of Bikes and Loans that are registered in the LoanBook, filtered by a Predicate.
* Undo/redo operations.

The component's class diagram is given below:

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The API is backed by a `ModelManager` which contains:
* A `VersionedLoanBook` object which tracks the main data (i.e. Bikes and Loans) within the LoanBook.
* A filtered list each for Bikes and Loans to expose to the UI.
* A `UserPrefs` object to track the user's preferences.

Most operations passed to the `Model` component deals with its `VersionedLoanBook`. A `VersionedLoanBook` is simply a regular `LoanBook` that keeps track of its own history, for the undo/redo operation. The `LoanBook` itself contains:
* A `LoanIdManager` that helps to assign a unique `LoanId` to every Loan, so that Loans may be easily identified.
* A list of unique Bikes.
* A list of unique Loans.

[NOTE]
A unique list in the sense above is a list where no two elements are the "same":
* A Bike is considered to be the same as another Bike if their Names match.
* A Loan is considered to be the same as another Loan if their LoanIds match.
We want to exclude duplicate items from these lists to make sure that identifying any given Bike or Loan is simple and without ambiguity. +

To facilitate this structure, both the `Bike` and `Loan` class implement a `UniqueListItem` interface, and the Bike and Loan lists inherit from a `UniqueList` class.

Most of the commands passed into the Model are forwarded to its `LoanBook`, who then executes these commands on the Bike and Loan lists that it has.

A *Loan* contains:
* The customer's particulars: Their `Name`, `Nric`, `Phone` and `Email`.
* The `Bike` that the customer is renting.
* A `LoanStatus` used signal whether this Loan is `Ongoing`, `Returned` or `Deleted`.
* A `LoanId` used for identifying this Loan.
* A `LoanRate` specifying the rate which the bicycle is being loaned at, in $/hr.
* A `loanStartTime` and `loanEndTime`, specifying the scheduled start and end times of the loan. `loanEndTime` might be `null` if the loan has no scheduled return time.
* Any number of `Tag` s to provide additional details for the Loan.

A *Bike* contains:
* A `Name` used for identifying this Bike.

[NOTE]
The `DataField` class is used to unify the common idea that the above details for Loans and Bikes are specifiable by a user-inputted String. The only exception is the Bike field in the Loan class, which is specified using the Bike's Name instead.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Loan Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `loanbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedLoanBook`.
It extends `LoanBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `loanBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedLoanBook#commit()` -- Saves the current loan book state in its history.
* `VersionedLoanBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous loan book state from its history.
* `VersionedLoanBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone loan book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitLoanBook()`, `Model#undoLoanBook()` and `Model#redoLoanBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedLoanBook` will be initialized with the initial loan book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single loan book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th loan in the loan book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitLoanBook()`, causing the modified state of the loan book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `loanBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted loan book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new loan. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitLoanBook()`, causing another modified loan book state to be saved into the `loanBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitLoanBook()`, so the loan book state will not be saved into the `loanBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the loan was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoLoanBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous loan book state, and restores the loan book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial loan book state, then there are no previous loan book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoLoanBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoLoanBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the loan book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `loanBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest loan book state, then there are no undone loan book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoLoanBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the loan book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitLoanBook()`, `Model#undoLoanBook()` or `Model#redoLoanBook()`. Thus, the `loanBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitLoanBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `loanBookStateList`, all loan book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire loan book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the loan being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of loan book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedLoanBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::adminauthentication[]
=== Admin Authentication
Before critical actions such as deleting a loan can be performed, admin authentication
should be required. This ensures that only authorized users are able to perform critical actions.
This is done by requiring a password before performing a critical action.

* Current Implementation *
There are three stages in this implementation:

==== Allowing the `delete` command to accept a password
1. To allow `delete` command to accept a password, we set a stub password of `a12345` and require all `delete` command to take in a password argument.
* When password is wrong, we do not perform the deletion of the loans.
* Only when password matches with stub password will the loan be deleted.
2. Existing tests were edited to include and check for a valid password before deletion.

[NOTE]
The default password for a new app is `a12345`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the new `delete` operation works.

image::deleteLoanWithPass.png[width="1000"]

==== Allow changing of master password

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `setpass` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `UserPref` file will initialise the password as `a12345`.

Step 2. The user executes `setpass a12345 newP4sS` command to change the password to `newP4sS`.

Step 3. `Password` class will encrypt the password, and call Model#setPass, that changes the password of the application in `UserPref`.

[NOTE]
If the current password input is wrong, it will not call Model#setPass, so the UserPref state will not be saved.

[NOTE]
If the current password input the same as the new password input, it will not call Model#setPass, so the UserPref state will not be saved.

Step 4. Password in `UserPref` is set to new password input.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `setpass` operation works:

image::setPasswordLogic.png[width="800"]

==== Encrypt current password for security
To ensure that others are unable to retrieve the app's password from the preference.json, we encrypt the password before storing. Decryption of password can only be done by the `Password` class.

This is currently done by appending `-encrypt` to the password, and removing it when
decrypting. For version 2.0, we plan to utilise existing libraries to encrypt and
decrypt our stored password.

// end::userconfirmation[]

=== Return a Loan feature

A LoanBook application that only allows users to do loans without being able to return them would not serve its purpose. When you take out a loan, it should automatically come with the feature of being returnable. This is the functionality for that.

==== Proposed Implementation

Returning a loan is done by setting the corresponding status of the loan to `LoanStatus.RETURNED`. Other than setting the enum to be returned, the cost of the loan will also be calculated and displayed to the user.

The steps that have to be done by LoanBook is as follows:

* Check the start and end time of the loan to ensure that the loan period is valid.
* Store the current time as the return time of the loan.
* Change the enum of `LoanStatus` to become `LoanStatus.RETURNED`.
* Calculate the cost of the loan and display it in the GUI as a suggestion for the user.

These steps would change the given `Loan` object, and update the properties of the `Loan` object. The appropriate values stored within the `Loan` object would therefore change accordingly.

Given below is an example usage scenerio and how the internals of the Loan would behave:

**Step 1.** The user would have to do a search for which loan they would like to return. This will pull up a list of loans from which the user would be able to select the correct loan.

**Step 2.** Using the current system time as the `endTime`, the duration of the loan will be calculated. Should the duration ever be negative, an error message will be thrown. This is because such a scenario would not ever be possible in the LoanBook.

**Step 3.** The user decides to return the current loan (in the case of the above image, the user wants to return loan at index 3, as selected). User will therefore key in `return i/3`.

The LoanBook will save the current time into the `LoanTime endTime` field. This would be done by calling the constructor `LoanTime()`. Also, the loanStatus field would also be updated from `ONGOING` to `RETURNED`.

image::return-loan-loan2.png[]
Note that originally the loan has a `null` value for end time. Note that the `endTime` and `loanStatus` values has been updated.

[TIP]
If the loan has already been returned or deleted, a corresponding error message will notify you that you cannot return a loan that is not ongoing. The message will also display the current status of the loan for troubleshooting. This check happens during this step.

{nbsp} +

**Step 4.** The function now calculates the cost of the loan. This price would be based on the amount of time the loan was active for, as well as the loanRate that was set, by multiplying the time with the rate.

[NOTE]
Although the time saved is to the millisecond, the time that is multiplied when we are getting the cost is rounded down to the nearest minute. In a sense, this is "pro-rating" the cost, and making it more discrete.

The result is then displayed into the GUI for the user as the cost price of the loan.

[NOTE]
It is possible for the LoanBook to have a loan that lasts for 0 minutes. This is because there may be some weird edge case where an object is loaned for less than a minute, which gets prorated down.

{nbsp} +

==== Design considerations:
===== Aspect: Using an enum vs changing the location of the loan
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** To create an enum that will store the status of the linked list.
** Pros: Easy to implement the return a loan feature, and do not need to create new data storage features.
** Cons: When using the `summary` function, it will take a longer amount of time, as the LoanBook would have to do a check at every step to ensure the correct data is appended to the correct place.

* Alternative 2: Create new ArrayLists of `Loans` for each possible status of the `Loan` objects.
** Pros: Computing the `summary` of the LoanBook would be much easier, and quicker.
** Cons: `return` functionality would run much slower, as there will be empty slots in the ArrayList after shifting the Loan objects around. Searching for loans would also be much more difficult, as the results from the various Loan ArrayLists has to be appended together.

=== Summary Feature

In order to allow the user to use the LoanBook effectively as an auditing tool, they must be able to get a summary of all the loans that they have made. This summary should ideally give them an idea of the statistics of each of their transactions at a glance.

==== Proposed Implementation

Getting the summary of all the loans is simply done by looping through all the stored loans before and aggregating the statistics of all the loans.

Currently, the `summary` command displays to the user the following statistics:

* Total number of ongoing loans
* Total number of loans ever taken out
* Total amount of time all bikes have been loaned for
* Total revenue from the loan service

This would give a very handy summary page as well as a printable audit page for the bicycle shop owners.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the internals of the LoanBook behaves:

**Step 1.** The user simply has to type the `summary` keyword into the CLI.

**Step 2.** The LoanBook proceeds to loop through all the loans and aggregate the statistics of the loans.

**Step 3.** The LoanBook updates the display with the aggregated statistics, and this can be screenshotted by the user as a summary page.

==== Design considerations:
===== Aspect: Getting the summary
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Looping through the entire list of loans to get the summary of the content
** Pros: Easy to implement, and do not need to create new data storage features.
** Cons: Looping through all loans will take more time, as the LoanBook would have to check every loan and recalculate.

* Alternative 2: Use a cache to store previously calculated values of the summaries.
** Pros: Quicker response time to the users.
** Cons: Much harder to implement, cache might break if user edits past loans.

==== Future features
We plan to include a feature which allows users to summarize the LoanBook based on certain parameters. For example, in future implementations, the user will be able to filter the statistics based on the identity of a bicycle.

These are the proposed features you would be able to search based on:

* Bicycle
* Time period
* Person who took out the loan

As well, having to recalculate all the loans would be a bad idea when the LoanBook contains many loans. A proposed solution would be to cache the results of the main summary method, so that the LoanBook would only have to recalculate the numbers based on loans that have not been added to the final tally.

Another idea would be to display all the loans in a printable table, when the summary feature is called. Perhaps this would generate a pdf file which shows all the list of loans that the LoanBook is keeping track of. Users can then take use this as a more stringent auditing tool.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Bicycle Management

As bicycles have a lot of properties, statuses and actions associated with them, they are represented in the code base as a dedicated `Bike` class.

Each `LoanBook` will have its own list of `Bike` s, representing all the bicycles that a bicycle shop owner has at their disposal. For the most part, the list of bicycles will be maintained in the same way as the list of loans.

Every bicycle will have the following members:

* `name`: A name that uniquely identifies the bicycle, e.g. the bicycle's serial number.
* `status`: The bicycle's current status that represents where it is or what it is doing, e.g. `Available`, `Loaned Out`, `On Display`, `Under Repair`.
* `loanHistory`: A list of past loans associated with this bicycle, sorted chronologically.
* `loanReserves`: A list of future loans (i.e. reservations) associated with this bicycle, sorted chronologically.
* Traits that characterize the bicycle, such as `brand`, `model`, `top speed`, `wheel size`, `weight`, `material` etc.

The new structure of the Loan Book is demonstrated in the class diagram below:

image::BicycleManagementClassDiagram.png[width="720"]

[NOTE]
Why does the bicycle track loans using two lists, instead of collating them into one big list? Because each list has a specific category of loans and it is more common to encounter situations that deal with only one of the lists (e.g. checking transaction history, or checking for clashes with reservations), rather than both.

Every `Loan` will have a reference to exactly one `Bike`: the bicycle that is loaned out. Conversely, every `Bike` has two lists of references of `Loan` s, which track the bicycle's loan history and future reservations.

[NOTE]
This makes the `LoanBook` 's list of loans a little harder to manage, due to the extra references. However, we have chosen to implement it anyway as referencing a bicycle's history is a very useful and frequently used operation. To manage the deletion of loans, the loan will be dereferenced from the Bike it references before it gets deleted. The sequence diagram below demonstrates this process:

image::DeleteLoanSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Due to the dependency of `Loan` s on `Bike` s, any bicycle that has been loaned out at least once will never be deleted from the system, merely archived and labelled `Decommissioned`. The `Bike` can still be deleted completely if all of the `Loan` s associated with it are deleted (i.e. invalidated) first.

Using this framework, it is now more efficient to implement and use a set of mini-features and operations to facilitate bicycle management, as detailed in the following sections:

==== Visible bicycle statuses
The current availability of bicycles are tracked by LoanBook. Bicycles can thus be filtered by whether they are available or not, and the available ones are readily visible in the UI.

==== Invalid loans
Loaning out a particular bicycle during the time which it is unavailable or has already been reserved will be denied. This prevents accidents in loaning out bicycles.

* When attempting to loan out a bicycle, the associated bicycle is retrieved from the system.
[NOTE]
The loan will be rejected if no bicycle is found that matches the bicycle name provided.

* If the loan will take effect immediately, the bicycle's status is checked. If the bicycle is unavailable, the loan is rejected, and the bicycle's status is reported to the user.
* If the loan is a reservation, i.e. it schedules a loan for the future, the bicycle's future reservations are checked. LoanBook will attempt to insert the reservation into the list of existing reservations. If the reservation clashes with the one directly before or after it, the loan is rejected, and the clash is reported to the user.

==== Bicycles for particular needs
The list of bicycles can be filtered using the same algorithm to filter the list of loans in order to find bicycles with particular properties, to suit particular customer's needs or activities.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Internal representation of bicycles

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have a dedicated `Bike` class.
** Pros: OO design. Easier to track status of bicycles. Bicycles can support more properties and features.
** Cons: Complex internal representation. Additional memory used for tracking Bikes.

* **Alternative 2:** Identify bikes by their names used in the Loans.
** Pros: Simpler internal representation. Less data to manage internally or in storage.
** Cons: Data on bikes have to be algorithmically searched for. Bicycles are assumed to exist and there is no verification for mistyped bicycle names. More difficult to implement bike-specific features.

=== Hide private information

Users must provide some important and personal information when adding a loan, e.g. `Nric`, so it is our responsibility to protect their privacy.

As a result, we have added a new feature to hide the private information from the Window. +
Example: The customer's `Nric` as stored in the database is `Nric: G1234567U`, but our `LoanCard` will only show `Nric: Gxxxxx67U`.

image::LoanListPanelView.png[]

==== Current implementation

Hidden private information is facilitated by an interface called `Censor`. It is implemented by classes `Nric`, `Phone` and `Email`.

When showing a new loan, it will do the following operations:

* `LoanCard#LoanCard()` -- the constructor will assign values to each of the labels shown in the LoanCard.

* `Nric#getCensored()` -- censor the Nric value and hide the first five digital numbers. Then it returns the censored String.

* `Nric#doCensoring(int length)` -- Take in the length of the Nric String and return the censored part ("x" part) according to the length.

* `Phone#getCensored()` -- censor the phone number and hide the first five digital numbers. Then it returns the censored String.

* `Phone#doCensoring(int length)` -- Take in the length of the Phone String and return the censored part ("x" part) according to the length.

* `Email#getCensored()` -- censor the email address and hide every characters except the last two characters in the local-part and the domain.

* `Email#doCensoring(int length)` -- Take in the length of the Email String and return the censored part ("x" part) according to the length.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step1.** The user adds a new loan to the LoanBook. A new `LoanCard` object will be created. +
The `LoanCard` object will contain information on the loan: `LoanID`, `BikeID`, `Name`, `Nric`, `Phone`, `Email`, `LoanRate` and `LoanTime`.

**Step2.** Assign the value of each of the components to their corresponding labels. +
For example: `name.setText(loan.getName().value);` will directly assign the name String of this loan to the `name` label. +

However, the values of `Nric`, `Phone` and `Email` need censoring before assigning their values, so they will call their own `getCensored()` method in their class. +
`getCensored()` in each of these class will call their corresponding `doCensoring(int)` method. Then combine the censored part and remain part and return. +
For example: `phone.setText(loan.getPhone().getCensored().value);` will censor the value of the phone String of this loan and then assign the censored value to the `phone` label.

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

image::HideInfoSequenceDiagrams.png[]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to execute getCensored() and doCensoring(int)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: each class implements from `Censor` interface.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons:

* **Alternative 2**: `Loan` class implements from `Censor` interface.
** Pros: Maybe easy to understand.
** Cons: The method might be bulky.

==== How to see the hidden information

The censored data are only hidden from the window, not changed in the database. The `BrowserPanel` on the bottom right of the window will still show all the information including the hidden information.

=== Send Reminder Email feature

==== Current Implementation

The email sending mechanism is supported by the https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/mail/package-summary.html[`JavaMail`] library. This feature is composed of three commands: `checkemail`, `setemail` and `remind`.

* `checkemail` command: display the email address that the user has set to send emails from. The app will censor the email address.
[NOTE]
If user has not set an email, the email address will be a string `"default"` and the app show a "You have not set your email yet!" message.

* `setemail` command: set the email address used for sending reminders to the customers.
[NOTE]
Only gmail is accepted by the app.

* `remind` command: automatically generate an email containing some core information about the loan, and send it to the corresponding customer from user's email. This command will use the `JavaMail` library.
[NOTE]
The email will contain the `Name`, `BikeId`, `LoanStartTime` and `LoanRate` of the loan.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the reminder email mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application for the first time. The user's email address is string `"default"` by default.

*Step 2.* The user executes `checkemail`. The following sequence diagram shows how `checkemail` works:

image::CheckEmailSequenceDiagram.png[]

The command executes `Model#getMyEmail()`, which calls `UserPrefs#getDefaultEmail()` and returns user's email stored in `UserPref`. The app checks if user's email equals to `"default"`. In this case, they are equal, so it throws a `CommandException`.

*Step 3.* The user executes `setemail OLDEMAIL NEWEMAIL`. This command does a few checks first:

.. If `OLDEMAIL` is not equal to either `"default"` or the previously set email, then a `CommandException` is thrown, as the validation of the old email fails.

.. Otherwise, the app then checks if `OLDEMAIL` and `NEWEMAIL` are equal. If so, then a `CommandException` is thrown, to warn the user that they are setting the same email as last time.

.. Otherwise, `SetEmailCommand#isValidGmail(NEWEMAIL)` is called to check if `NEWEMAIL` is a valid gmail. If not, a `CommandException` is thrown to warn the user that they are setting the same email as last time.

*Step 4.* The user forgets what email he has set before, so he executes `checkemail` again. The procedure is the same as in *Step 2*. However, the app detects that user's email is not `"default"` this time, so it creates an `Email(userEmail)` object and executes `Email#getCensored()`. Then, the function returns a `CommandResult` with a success message and the censored user email.

*Step 5.* The user sends a reminder email to a customer by executing `remind x/EMAILPASSWORD n/NAME b/BIKEID`. This command implements the following operations:

a. Get a list of `Loans` from the `LoanBook` class and execute `RemindCommand#getLoan(list, NAME, BIKE)` to check if there is a `loan` that contains both this `NAME` and `BIKE`.

b. If it returns a non-null `loan`, then check its `LoanStatus`.

c. If its `LoanStatus` is `LoanStatus.ONGOING`, create a `SendReminder(model, EMAILPASSWORD, loan)` object and execute `SendReminder#send()` to send email. +
The `SendReminder#send()` method calls `SendReminder#createReminderEmail(session, userEmail)` to create the content of the email, connects user's email using `EMAILPASSWORD` and finally send the email.
[NOTE]
If the user cannot remember the customer's `NAME` or the loaned `BIKE`, he can use the `find [NAME] [BIKE]` command to search for the target loan.
[NOTE]
For Steps (a) and (b), if the next step cannot be executed, a `CommandException` with corresponding failure message will be thrown.
[NOTE]
If it throws a `CommandException` with authentication failed message in step (c), please check if user's email and password are correct. If they are, please make sure that the `Less secure apps` setting of user's email is enabled. If it is not, enable it and refresh the page.

==== Design considerations
*Aspect: use user's personal email vs share an immutable common email*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use a user-specified email.

** Pros:
*** The user has a choice of what email address to use.
*** The user needs to type in the correct password if they want to send a reminder email, which ensures the security and privacy of the email.

** Cons:
*** The user needs to enable the `Less secure apps` setting, which could be a security concern.

* *Alternative 2:* Use a common email provided by the app.

** Pros:
*** The user does not need to set their own email when sending reminder emails, reducing hassle when setting up.
*** The user does not need to type in a password when sending a reminder email.

** Cons:
*** The common email is less secure, as its password can be found within the program.
*** The password of the common email can be changed by malicious users.
*** The email might get overloaded.
*** Customers might receive spam emails, as the `remind` command does not require a password.

==== Future considerations
We plan to add a feature that can automatically send an e-receipt to the customer after `return` ing a loan.

The e-receipt will contain the `Name`, `BikeID`, `LoanStartTime`, `LoanEndTime` and `TotalCost` of the loan.

=== [Proposed] Improved `delete` functionality

==== Current Implementation
When the user deletes a loan from the LoanBook, it deletes the correct loan, then commits the result into memory. What this entails is that the entire XML file gets overwritten when each delete command is being called.

==== Proposed implementation:
From above, there is already a `LoanStatus` that has been implemented. What this does is that it allows the loan to be marked as deleted by setting the enum to the appropriate value. This would result in the LoanBook not needing to recommit every change.

From here, when the user decides to close the LoanBook, it will then loop through all the loans and filter out the ones which have not been deleted. These are the loans that would be kept and saved in the LoanBook.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect: Deleting a loan**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Remove each loan as they are deleted
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Large time taken for memory operations as reading and writing to the data is required.

* Alternative 2 (proposed implementation): Use an enum to implement lazy deletion.
** Pros: Much more time efficient due to lazy deletion
** Cons: Implementation is harder, and changing to this implementation would affect the undo and redo features.

* Alternative 3: Fix the LoanBook storage manager so that it does not rewrite the entire XML file after each delete operation.
** Pros: All operations are now lazy. Much better performance of the application because commit operations do not need to change the large XML file.
** Cons: Large refactoring work required. May potentially affect the timeline of development of the other functions.

== Documentation

This section describes the way we document our project. We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

We write extensive tests to prevent regression and allow other developers to build on our work without fear of breaking other parts. This section provides the necessary steps to run tests.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `loanbook.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `loanbook.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `loanbook.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `loanbook.logic.LogicManagerTest`

[WARNING]
====
The tests within the `add` command parsers do not take into account the feedback string from within the display. This is because of the time sensitive nature of the `add` command. It does not take in a specific `LoanTime` when the loan is created and populates the current system time into the `Loan`. Therefore, the strings that is returned for each command is time dependant. Hence it is impossible to do a string matching on the returned display string and a hard coded value.

In this case, we commented out the check for equality of the string from the `add` command in the GUI against the expected hard coded string.
====

[NOTE]
====
However we do not need to test the equality of the displayed strings to ensure that the `add` command is working properly. We can simply check that the size of the list of `Loans` in the LoanBook has increased by 1, as well as to ensure that the `Loan` that was added into the LoanBook has the same base property as the default `Loan` that was added.

An alternative would be to use a regex to do string pattern matching on the added `Loan`. This can be combined with getting the current system time of the tests to check that the display strings match, and the saved `Loans` are correctly added. However, this modification would take time to develop and to ensure that it is correct. As such, such developments would be left to be completed in future releases of LoanBook.
====


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This sections provides a brief summary of the tools we use in the project, and how to integrate them into the project.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Code Quality

We use https://www.codacy.com/[Codacy] to track the code quality of our projects. See <<UsingCodacy#, UsingCodacy.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/loanbook/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Loan Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

LoanBook targets users who run a bicycle rental business in Singapore. Users who will find this product especially useful are those who are familiar with desktop applications, and who prefer using a command-line interface (CLI) over a graphic user interface (GUI) for input. A reason for this preference is that using a mouse to access app features may be slower and more accident-prone than typing on a keyboard.
