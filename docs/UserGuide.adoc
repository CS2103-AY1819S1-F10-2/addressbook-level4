== Introduction

Have you ever seen your clients waiting angrily for 15 minutes before finally getting their rental bikes? Introducing Forever A-Loan, a lightweight Command Line Interface (CLI) application that revolutionizes the way bike loans are logged. Forever A-Loan promises to drastically decrease the time taken for bike rental shop owners to manage their inventories by leveraging on state of the art inventory management algorithms and the absence of a clunky Graphical User Interface (GUI) that hinders fast typists. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `LoanBook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Run the .jar file. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[ENTER] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[ENTER] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : List the status of the loanbook
* **`add`**`p/John hp/12345678 e/john@abc.com r/3 o/Bicycle-007` : Loans Bicycle-007 to John at a rate of $3 per hour
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd loan shown in the current list
* *`reset`* : Reset the loanbook

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

Format: `edit i/LOAN_ID [p/PERSON_NAME] [hp/PERSON_PHONE_NO] [e/PERSON_EMAIL] [r/RATE] [o/OBJECT_IDENTITY]`

****

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

=== Deleting the chosen loan from the loan book : `delete`

****
* Deletes the loan at the specified `i/LOAN_ID`.
* Note that this does not reset `LOAN_ID`.
* Deletion will not occur if `CURRENT_PASSWORD` is incorrect.

====

Examples:

* `delete i/11037 x/a12345` +
Deletes the loan with LOAN_ID 11037.

****
* Set the password of the app to `NEW_PASSWORD`
* Password change will not occur if `CURRENT_PASSWORD` is incorrect.

The difference between deleting all the loans and hard resetting the LoanBook is that when a loan is delete, you will still be able to search for it. However, the statistics of deleted loans do not appear in the `summary` command.
====

[WARNING]
====
**Hard resetting the LoanBook will remove ALL loans! Do this ar your own peril.**
====

=== Summarize all the transactions : `summary`

Show the total number of loans that are done and in progress. Also summarizes the loan status of each item, the number of times an object was loaned before.

The `summary` function would display the statistics of all your loans in the display box on the right of the application. There, you will find the following statistics:

* Total number of ongoing loans
* Total number of loans ever taken out
* Total amount of time all bikes have been loaned for
* Total revenue from the loan service
