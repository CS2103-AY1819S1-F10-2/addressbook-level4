== Summary of contributions

This section provides a brief summary on the contributions of major and minor enhancement I made for the project.

* *Major enhancement*: Added a password feature to improve the integrity of the app's data.
** What it does:
**** Allow user to set password and change password for the app, so that critical comments that affects statistical integrity (Transaction summery & Tax-filing) cannot be performed by unauthorised personnel. Password stored is also encrypted to prevent hackers from retrieving the password.
** Justification:
**** This feature improves the product significantly because now, only authorized users are able use the critical commands (E.g. `delete` command) to delete loans. Without this, the data from the summary report may be incorrect, affecting tax-filling, revenue management.
** Highlights:
*** Allow users to change the password of the app, ensuring that the same password is not used for a long time.
*** Encryption using randomly generated salts provide a higher level of encryption as hackers will not be able to reverse engineer the password.
*** Inputs of commands requiring password no longer appears in the command history.
*** Existing commands was modified to require a password input.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Create NRIC class to store Singapore issued NRIC. Also include a checksum validation to ensure correct NRIC. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/pull/36[#36]]
** Allow searching for loans of specific date. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/pull/158[#158]]
** Using tags to notify users on the status of loans. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/pull/163[#163]]
