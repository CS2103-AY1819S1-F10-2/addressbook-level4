This portfolio page collates and document my contributions towards the development of the project. It serves to showcase the technical knowledge I have learned throughout the course in CS2103T. My resume and full portfolio can be found [https://weineng.io[here]].

== LoanBook -- The all-in-one app to manage your bicycle rental business!

Physical management of bicycle loans using pen and paper is hard to organise, unfriendly to the environment and extremely slow.
Coupled with the rising competition from bicycle sharing companies such as ofo and MoBike, it is more important than ever for bicycle rental companies
to streamline their process and be more efficient to stay competitive. Introducing LoanBook,
a free inventory management software with all the features required for a bicycle rental businesses to be more efficient. By parsing commands typed by users, a mouse is no longer required to use the app. Compared to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or the traditional pen and paper, fast typists will find that LoanBook allows user to manage bicycle loans much faster.

*Noteworthy features includes*:

* Managing bicycles statuses
* Summary report for loan in a given period
* Email reminding feature to remind users about their pending loan, with future plans for e-receipts
* Authentication to ensure integrity of the application's data

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section provides a brief summary on the contributions I made for the project._
|===
* *Major enhancement*: Added an authentication feature to improve the integrity of the app's data.
** What it does:
**** Allow users to set password and change password for the app, so that critical comments that affects statistical integrity (Transaction summery & Tax-filing) cannot be performed by unauthorised personnel. Password stored is also encrypted to prevent hackers from retrieving the password.
** Justification:
**** This feature improves the product significantly because now, only authorized users are able use the critical commands (E.g. `delete` command) to delete loans. Without this, the data from the summary report may be incorrect, affecting tax-filling, revenue management.
** Highlights:
*** Allow users to change the password of the app, ensuring that the same password is not used for a long time.
*** Encrypt password using randomly generated salts to provide a higher level of encryption. This ensures that hackers will not be able to reverse engineer the password. Used code by http://www.appsdeveloperblog.com/encrypt-user-password-example-java/[Sergey Kargopolov].
*** Arguments of commands that requires a password no longer appears in the command history.
*** Existing commands was modified to require a password input. (E.g. `delete`)

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Create NRIC class to manage Singapore issued NRIC. Also include a checksum validation to ensure validity of NRIC. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/pull/36[#36]]
** Allow searching for loans of specific date. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/pull/158[#158]]
** Using tags to notify users on the status of loans. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/pull/163[#163]]
